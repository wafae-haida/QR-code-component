## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use HTML5 for semantic markup, CSS for styling, and Flexbox for creating responsive layouts. I also explored the box-sizing: border-box; property to ensure consistent element sizing and the importance of media queries for a mobile-first workflow. Additionally, I've effectively integrated these concepts to create a well-structured, responsive webpage.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<div class="flex-container">
  <div class="container">
  </div>
  <div class="attribution">
  </div>
</div>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  flex-direction: column;
  height: 100vh;
  gap: 15px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  padding: 15px;
  max-width: 230px;
  text-align: center;
  font-family: 'Roboto', Arial, sans-serif;
}
```

### Continued development

As a beginner in creating responsive pages, I've learned to use HTML and CSS for foundational web development. I'm excited to tackle more complex challenges with multiple components. I'll focus on mastering Flexbox and Grid layouts, refining media queries, and building reusable components like navigation bars and modals.
